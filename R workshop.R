##Starting R
#You can interact with R through the Console or in the script
#Console automatically runs the code
#Script requires you to press "Run" or ctrl + Enter
1 + 1

2 - 1

#Multiply (*) and divide (/)
2 * 3

6 / 2

#Squaring numbers (^)
2 ^ 3

#Square roots
sqrt(25)

#R follows BEDMAS/PEMDAS

#IMPORTANT: R does not save your work unless prompted to
#"<-" allows you to save values by assigning it a variable
x <- 1 + 1

#You can then call back those values by typing in the variable
X

#Those variables will take on the property of the assigned values
X - 1
Y <- X * 3
Y / 2

#You can assign multiple values to a variable
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

#The variable can be any name as long as the name does not contain a space.
#Common replacements are "_" and "."

#In addition to numeric values, you can also store strings
spider_size <- c("Small", "Small", "small", "small", "Big", "Big", "Big", "Big")
