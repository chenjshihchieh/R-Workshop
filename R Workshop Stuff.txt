###Important Concepts
#R is a programming language that allows a computer to take inputs, make calculations, and generate outputs

The language consists of objects and actions
There are two main syntaxes in R that underlie all R codes
- Object Action Object-(e.g., two plus two)
- Action(Object)-(e.g., stack(Bun, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheese, Beef Patty, Bun))

The rest is learning different types of objects and actions

##Object Action Object with Numerical Objects
 5 + 5

(5 + 5) + 15

##Action(Object)
sqrt(25)

sqrt(25) + 20

sqrt(sqrt(25) + 20)

Reminders:
Write on whiteboard: Object Action Object and Action(Object)
